# Brandcast Remote Technical Challenge

Take no more than 2 hours to complete this challenge. We are most interested in your approach and the reasons behind your decisions, as opposed to a perfectly working solution. As such, we would like at least partial solutions to all 2 parts of the test, so plan your time accordingly.

After 2 hours has passed, please tar or zip up your project and email it to [conor@brandcast.com](mailto:conor@brandcast.com?subject=Brandcast%20Technical%20Test).

## Tech Stack:
We use React and Redux at Brandcast, but you can use what you are comfortable with, as long as the solution is written in Javascript.

Here's a [React boilerplate](https://github.com/survivejs/react-boilerplate) if you choose to use it.

## Part One:
* Design a data structure to store a single parent family tree
* each family member can have zero or more children
* each family member can have an indefinite number of properties, e.g. name, gender, favorite color, etc.
* there should not be a limit on the depth of the family tree

## Part Two:
* Render the family tree in the browser
* you are not getting graded on visual design or style
